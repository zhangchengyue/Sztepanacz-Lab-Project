# Drosophila Wing Size Estimation Project
This is a semi-automatic Python code to detect and measure the Drosophila suzukii wing size. The code is written with reference to the paper Drosophila suzukii wing spot size is robust to developmental temperature written by Ceferino Varón-González et.al.

# Requirements:
* Package used: OpenCV
* Python version: 3.10

# How to use:
Go to __**mine**__ -> __**final.py**__ to run the code.

# TODO:
* Change the Global variable __**name**__ and __**path**__ to the route of the image
* Adjust the landmarsk to cut the unwanted part. This can be improved by using __**ImageJ**__ to detect the landmarks.
 
# Description about each folder:
* __**mind**__: Stores python files used for the project. Compile __**final.py**__ to run.
* __**pics**__: Stores original images captured from microscope
* __**Dryad files**__: The original source code from the author of the paper
* __**data**__: File __**line_coordinator.txt**__ is used to draw the reference line
